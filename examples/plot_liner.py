The transmission loss (TL) along a duct liner
==================================================

In this example we compute the transmission-loss of a duct liner with grazing flow (M=0.25). The data used in this
example was part of `this study <https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2020-2615>`_\,
which is referred to here for further details.

# %%
# 1. Initialization
# -----------------
# First, we import the packages needed for this example.
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import acdecom
# %%
# The liner is mounted along a duct with a rectangular cross section of the dimensions (0.02 m x 0.11 m).
# The highest frequency of interest is 1000 Hz. The bulk Mach-number is 0.25 and the temperature is 295 Kelvin.
section = "rectangular"
a = 0.02  # m
b = 0.11  # m
f_max = 1500  # Hz
M = 0.25
t = 295  # Kelvin
# %%
# Test-ducts were mounted to the downstream and upstream side of the liner. Those ducts were equipped with
# three microphones, each. The first microphone on each side had a distance of 0.21 m to the liner.
distance_upstream = 0.21  # m
distance_downstream = 0.21  # m
# %%
# To analyze the measurement data, we create :class:`.WaveGuide` objects for the upstream and the downstream test ducts.
td_upstream = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(a, b), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="stinson",
                                distance=distance_upstream, M=M, temperature=t, flip_flow=True)
td_downstream = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(a, b), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="stinson",
                                  distance=distance_downstream, M=M, temperature=t)
# %%
#
# .. note::
#   The standard flow direction is in :math:`P_+` direction. Therefore, on the inlet side, the Mach-number must be
#   either set negative or the argument *flipFlow* must be set to *True*.
#
# .. note::
#   We use `Stinson's <https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.400379>`_ model for acoustic dissipation along the pipe.
#   This is more accurate than the model by Kirchoff (which is commonly used). However, it is computationally more
#   expensive.
#
# 2. Sensor Positions
# -------------------
# We define lists with microphone positions at the upstream and downstream side and assign them to the *WaveGuides*.

z_downstream = [0, 0.055, 0.248] # m
x_downstream = [a/2, a/2, a/2]  # deg
y_downstream = [0, 0, 0]   # m

z_upstream = [0.249, 0.059, 0]    # m
x_upstream = [a/2, a/2, a/2]  # deg
y_upstream = [0, 0, 0]  # m

td_upstream.set_microphone_positions(z_upstream, x_upstream, y_upstream)
td_downstream.set_microphone_positions(z_downstream, x_downstream, y_downstream)

# %%
# 3. Decomposition
# ----------------
#  Next, we read the measurement data. The measurement must be pre-processed in a format that is understood by the
#  :class:`.WaveGuide` object. Generally, this is a numpy.ndarray, wherein the columns contain the measurement data,
#  such as the measured frequency and the pressures at the microphone locations. The rows can be different frequencies
#  or different sound excitations (cases). In this example, the measurement was post-processed into a .txt file and can
#  be loaded with the `numpy.loadtxt <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html>`_ function.
#
# .. note::
#   The pressure used for the decomposition must be pre-processed, fo example to account for microphone calibration if
#   necessary.
#
pressure = numpy.loadtxt("data/liner.txt", dtype=complex, delimiter=",", skiprows=1)
# %%
# We examine the file's header to understand how the data is stored in our input file.
with open("data/liner.txt") as pressurefile:
    print(pressurefile.readline().split(","))
# %%
# The upstream microphones (1, 2, and 3) are in columns 5, 6, and 7. The Downstream microphones
# (3, 5, and 6) are in columns 8, 9, and 10. The case number is in the last column. All the other columns contain
# information that we do not need in this example.

f = 4
mics_ds = [18, 19, 20]
mics_us = [5, 6, 7]
case = -1

# %%
# Next, we decompose the sound fields into the propagating modes. We decompose the sound fields on the upstream
# and downstream side of the duct, using the two *WaveGuide* objects defined earlier.

decomp_us, headers_us = td_upstream.decompose(pressure, f, mics_us, case_col=case)

decomp_ds, headers_ds = td_downstream.decompose(pressure, f, mics_ds, case_col=case)

# %%
# .. note ::
#   The decomposition may show warnings for ill-conditioned modal matrices. This typically happens for frequencies close
#   to the cut-on of a mode. However, it can also indicate, that the microphone array is unable to separate the
#   modes. The condition number of the wave decomposition is stored in the data returned by
#   :meth:`.WaveGuide.decompose` and should be checked in case a warning is triggered.
#
# 4. Further Post-processing
# --------------------------
# We can print the *headersDS* to see the names of the columns of the arrays that store the decomposed sound fields.
#
print(headers_us)

# %%
# We use that information to extract the modal data.
minusmodes = [1]  # from headers_us
plusmodes = [0]
# %%
# Furthermore, we can get the unique decomposed frequency points.
frequs = numpy.abs(numpy.unique(decomp_us[:, headers_us.index("f")]))
nof = frequs.shape[0]

# %%
# For each of the frequencies, we can compute the scattering matrix by solving a linear system of equations
# :math:`S = p_+ p_-^{-1}`, where :math:`S` is the scattering matrix and  :math:`p_{\pm}` are matrices containing the
# acoustic modes placed in rows and the different test cases placed in columns.
#
# .. note::
#   Details for the computation of the Scattering Matrix and the procedure to measure the different test-cases can be
#   found in `this study <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2016/00000102/00000005/art00008>`_\.
