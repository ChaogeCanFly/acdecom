The empty circular duct with flow and higher-order modes
========================================================

In this example we extract higher-order modes from measurement data in a circular duct with moderate mean flow.
The data is part of `this study <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2016/00000102/00000005/art00008>`_\,
which is referred here for further details.

# %%
# 1. Initialization
# -----------------
# First, we import the packages needed for this example.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy
import acdecom
# %%
# The duct has a circular cross section and is filled with air for which we use the standard properties.
# The duct radius is 0.075 m. The distance from the microphones to the reference cross section is 0.55 m.
# The highest frequency of interest is 3200 Hz.
section = "circular"
radius = 0.075  # m
distance = 0.55  # [m]
f_max = 3200  # Hz
# %%
# We create objects for the upstream and the downstream section of the duct.
#
td_us = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(radius,), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="dokumaci",
                          distance=distance, flip_flow=True)
td_ds = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(radius,), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="dokumaci",
                          distance=distance)
# %%
#
# .. note::
#   The standard flow direction is in :math:`P_+` direction. On the upstream side, the Mach-number therefore must be
#   either set negative or the argument *flip_flow* must be set to *True*.
#
# 2. Sensor Positions
# -------------------
#
# The microphone coordinates are saved in a .txt file.

td_us.read_microphonefile("data/emptyUS.mic", cylindrical_coordinates=True)
td_ds.read_microphonefile("data/emptyDS.mic", cylindrical_coordinates=True)

# %%
#
# .. note::
#   In this case, the microphone coordinates are defined in a cylindrical coordinate system with the circumferential
#   position in deg. Therefore, we set the argument *cylindrical_coordinates* to *True*. This will transform the
#   circumferential position from deg. to radians.
#
# 3. Decomposition
# ----------------
#
# The measurement must be pre-processed in a format that is understood by the *WaveGuide* object. Generally,
# this must be a numpy.ndarray, wherein the columns contain the measurement data, such as the measured frequency, the
# pressure values for that frequency, the bulk Mach-number, and the temperature. The rows can be different frequencies
# or different sound excitations (cases). In this example, the
# measurement was post-processed into a .txt file and can be loaded with the
# `numpy.loadtxt <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html>`_ function.
#
# .. note::
#   The pressure used for the decomposition must be pre-processed, for example to account for microphone.
#
pressure = numpy.loadtxt("data/higherOrderModes.txt",dtype=complex, delimiter=",", skiprows=1)
# %%
# We examine the file header to understand how the data is stored in our input file.
with open("data/higherOrderModes.txt") as pressurefile:
    print(pressurefile.readline().split(","))
# %%
# Mach-number, temperature, and frequency are stored in columns 0, 1, and 2. The upstream microphones 1-12 are in
# columns 3 - 14, the downstream microphones 13-24 are in columns 15-26, and the case number is in the last column.
Mach_number = 0
temperature = 1
f = 2
mics_us = range(3, 15)
Mics_ds = range(15, 27)
case = -1
# %%
# Now, we can decompose the sound-fields into the propagating modes. We decompose the sound-fields on the upstream
# and downstream side of the duct, using the two *WaveGuide* objects defined earlier.
decomp_us, headers_us = td_us.decompose(pressure, f, mics_us, temperature_col=temperature, case_col=case,
                                        Mach_col=Mach_number)
decomp_ds, headers_ds = td_ds.decompose(pressure, f, Mics_ds, temperature_col=temperature, case_col=case,
                                        Mach_col=Mach_number)
# %%
# .. note ::
#   The decomposition may show warnings for ill-conditioned modal matrices. This typically happens for frequencies close
#   to the cut-on of a mode. However, it can also indicate that the microphone array is insufficient to separate the
#   modes. The condition number of the wave decomposition is stored in the data returned by *decompose* and
#   should be checked in case a warning is triggered.
#
# 4. Further Post-processing
# --------------------------
# We can print the *headers_ds* to see the names of the columns of the arrays that store the decomposed sound fields.
#
print(headers_ds)
# %%
# We use that information to extract the modal data for the different frequencies and cases.
plusmodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
minusmodes = [6,7,8,9,10,11]
# %%
# Furthermore, we can get the unique decomposed frequency points.
frequs = numpy.abs(numpy.unique(decomp_us[:,headers_us.index("f")]))
nof = frequs.shape[0]
# %%
# For each of the frequencies we can compute the scattering matrix by solving a linear system of equations
# :math:`S = p_+ p_-^{-1}`\, where :math:`S` is the scattering matrix and  :math:`p_{\pm}` are matrices containing the
# acoustic modes palded in rows and the different test cases placed in columns.
#
# .. note::
#   Details for the computation of the Scattering Matrix and the procedure to measure the different test-cases can be
#   found in `this study <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2016/00000102/00000005/art00008>`_\.
